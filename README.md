![Design preview for the Time tracking dashboard coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Third challenge on Frontend Mentor - first Junior challenge.

Estimated time taken: 3:15 hrs in HTML & CSS
                      2 hrs in JS => Learning Syntax & fetching data from Json file and applying css in JS.
                      COULD NOT make it work on my own. ( First time dealing with JSON )
                      So, I copied some code ( But now studying more about Json, manipulating css with JS and revising JS Basics)
